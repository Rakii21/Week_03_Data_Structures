## Overview

Week 3 was dedicated to hands-on implementation of essential data structures such as linked lists, stacks, queues, and hash maps. Students also covered algorithm design topics including sorting and searching techniques, string handling with mutable classes, and basic file input/output operations. The week concluded with a detailed study of algorithm runtime and Big-O notation.
